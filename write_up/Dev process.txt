Demo timeline

Believe it or not the demo started out back in August 2018 (suspiciously, shortly after Twisted Brain was released...!) as an attempt to learn 6502 assembly. Kieran got me interested in the BBC Demo Scene and I decided that I was going to learn 6502 coding and see whether I could come up with some interesting effects. While on a family holiday, while my family were sleeping, I downloaded BeebAsm and B-Em and started coding!

Shortly after I'd started playing around with the BeebAsm 'rotating globe' demo, I saw a discussion on Stardot (specifically this one (fill in link!)) about fully stable raster on the Beeb. Since Twisted Brain had been all about Vertical Rupture, I thought it would be fun to experiment with Stable Raster instead. By the end of the holiday I had an early 'test bars' effect which drew a series of static vertical bars by writing to the Video ULA Palette register.

I then started experimenting with a number of animated effects, sharing them with other members of Bitshifters, while they shared their own effects as well. Originally the plan had been to get them all working within Kieran's 'Just Rasters' framework (basically a 'shell' Twisted Brain which supports Stable Raster) but a few months before Nova Kieran had to start job-hunting which curtailed his 6502 coding activities. Although feeling pretty out of my depth I committed to trying to get a demo together for Nova, and Tom Seddon jumped in as well. This triggered several months of collaboration, with Tom, myself and several other team members chatting on Slack most nights.
