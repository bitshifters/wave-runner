Things to experiment with post-Wave-Runner.

Scrolltext:
- Fix the bug causing incorrect colour at the top.
- Make Scrolltext wibble more interesting by varying the
xWibble rate of change over time, ie make xWibble itself change according to a sine wave or some other pattern.
- Change yScale addition factor down the screen as well.
- Coloured glyphs.
- Animated / rotating glyphs.

General:
- Fix the "set 16bit value" and "set 16 bit jmp target" timeline functions. (Done in JSBeeb testing branch!)
