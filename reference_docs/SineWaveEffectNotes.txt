Zero-page vars to read:

- Start index. (Changed in post-update)
- Increment speed. (Ditto)

Later need to:

- Vary increment speed per-line, based on some other calc... (Maybe no time?)
- Vary start index change speed non-linearly.

- Change them all to 16-bit values, use most-significant byte when needed.


We need the "Render" function to start one raster line BEFORE the first VISIBLE line so we can delay an appropriate amount to ensure the first line
starts at the right place. This delay may be MUCH LONGER than subsequent delays, hence possibly need something other than a clockslide.

Get diff to PREVIOUS value.
Add constant to make it >= 0
