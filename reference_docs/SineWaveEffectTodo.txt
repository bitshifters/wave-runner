TODO:

- Implement version that has SECONDARY colour table and also sets that (two palette entries need setting!)
- Implement code to partially/fully swap the delay functions, so you get a non-linear sine pattern.
- Implement code that looks up colours in a 29-long table according to delay, instead of in the colour table.
- Make it possible to swap from 256-long colour table to 28-long table.
- Investigate using vrup to change the screen pattern!


What do I want to achieve?


- Nice-looking undulating pattern which wibbles across the screen.

- Starts as a simple black/white line, then slowly starts morphing into dynamic, living pattern.

- Moves from one side of screen to another to reveal an image.

- Then back again to reveal changed image?


- The transitions between one pattern and the next should be 'smooth' and 'nice', and not just lerps.

- Some kind of 'pulse' that starts at low intensity, builds up then fades away again leaving a different pattern in effect...


So to do this:

- Want to be able to play with patterns, then save out relevant values. Then easily interpolate from one set to another.

- To interpolate from one to another, we need an 'interpolate from ... to ... ' macro.

The macro works out the difference to apply per frame, and applies a correction to take it to the 'final' value on the final frame.


Then try saving out a few nice patterns, and seeing whether can interpolate between them.


Need a "kill all tasks" function which can be used when transitioning between effects?
